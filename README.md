**kottans _online_ course**

```
I had an experience using git, but udacity course was great, made usuful notes from it. Also I liked to play in git branching. 
I didn't work in a team greather than two people, so merging and resolving conflicts was new experience for me.

1. Nice course made as a game. Learnt a lot of new. Linux security topic was a bit difficult. Will use linux commands is terminal more often.
2. Second and third parts articles well presented. Would be nice to have more examples.

Awesome course with cool trainer. The work between remote forked, local and source repositories was a challenge.
